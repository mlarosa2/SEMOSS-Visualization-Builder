# semscaff

## What is this?
semscaff is a tool that generates the files necessary to build 
[SEMOSS](http://semoss.org/) visualizations (which are powered by [JVCharts](https://github.com/vrut57/jvCharts)). 

## How to install
semscaff is available via npm. Simply run npm install -g semscaff on the 
command line.

## How to use
To use semscaff, create a new directory under semoss/embed/widgets. The recommended 
naming convention for this directory is all lower case letters and kebab case if more than one word (ex. parallel-coordinates).
cd into this directory and on the command line enter: semscaff.

You will be prompted to answer a few yes or no questions, and some information 
about the fields required. Upon completion all the necessary files will be generated.
Don't forget to add your SVG!
